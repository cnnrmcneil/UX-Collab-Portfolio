                    <p class="cs_body_text">For this exciting passion project, our goal was to design a microsite for
                        an event and incorporate a feature that would
                        add value and improve the users experience. This website was built for the yogi community and
                        those interested in
                        exploring yoga activities.</p>

                        festivals could provide them before and
                        during the actual event. They also found it important to discover new wellness exercises at
                        the
                        festival that they would
                        then add to their daily routine to improve their lives.

                            for our users. Our first instinct was to research similar events and explore their offers.

                            If we wanted to stand out from our competitors, we had to analyze their products and
                            characteristics — This would be key
                            for determining which features our microsite would need to have to be competitive and where
                            we might add value with some

                        We knew to offer activity details was
                        incredibly important to our users, what we didn’t know was that we would face several

                        <li>We had too many screens and it made it difficult for our users to understand the end goal.

                        <li>The arrangement and taxonomy of most screens raised concerns about the payment and receipt
